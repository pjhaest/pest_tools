Version 0.1.0
------------
Initial commit

Description
-------------
Python modules used to aid in model calibration with PEST (Doherty, 2010).
 
Main goal is for quick development of visuals on important PEST output.

Current highlights include:
  - Read binary .jco file into pandas data frame
  - Calculate parameter sensitivity for all observations or with select observation groups removed
  - Calculate observation sensitivity
  - Quickly select and plot different views of parameter sensitivity (by group, most sensitive, least sensitive, etc.)
  - Read in output from JACTEST and plot data with interactive slider
  - Read in data from IDENTPAR and rank/plot
  - Read .rmr file from BEOPEST and plot a boxplot of run times by node
 
See examples for how things work.  

Dependancies
--------------

python 2.7.5
matplotlib 1.2.1
